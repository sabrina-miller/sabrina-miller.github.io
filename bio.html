	<h1> Bio </h1>
	<div class = "bio"> I am from Santa Cruz, California, but currently live in Medford, Massachusetts and attend Tufts University where I study computer engineering. When I'm not in class or working on homework, I enjoy playing the flute. I am a member of the Tufts Wind Ensemble, Flute Ensemble, and Symphony Orchestra. I also enjoy hiking, photography, and watching The Office. </div>
