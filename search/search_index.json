I do a lot of other things besides mess with computers! Music I've been playing flute since 2007. I am currently a member of the Tufts Symphony Orchestra, Tufts Wind Ensemble, and Tufts Flute Ensemble. I play many types of flutes - bass, alto, and (unfortunately) piccolo. I used to play the bass trombone as well, although it has been a while. Here's a concerto I played in 2015: Photography I enjoy nature and portrait photography. My camera has taken a bit of a break the past few years, but I am hoping to bring it out again soon. Here's my SmugMug . Powerlifting Lifting heavy things is fun! This is my favorite form of physical activity.","title":"About Me"},{"location":"personal/#about-me","text":"I am from Santa Cruz, California, but currently live in Medford, Massachusetts and attend Tufts University where I study Computer Engineering.

Designed and implemented circuits for colored path detection, sending and receiving messages, collision detection, motor control. Signals from the hand-soldered circuits were sent to an Arduino, which had various sets of code to complete challenges. Pulse Oximeter Pulse oximeter schematic Built and tested a circuit that read a patient\u2019s pulse. An infrared LED shone through a patient\u2019s finger, with a photosensor on the opposite side of the IR LED that responded according to how much IR light was absorbed by the blood in the patient\u2019s finger. This sensor voltage was passed through a bandpass filter with a gain of \u2248 60 dB to filter out DC signals and higher frequency noise. Feedback control was included (to correct for patient finger size) by reducing the light emitted from the IR LED when a smaller finger was in the detector. The current flow through the IR LED was reduced using an NMOS transistor. The transistor\u2019s gate was connected to the output of a differential amplifier, which took the difference between the DC signal from the photodetector and a reference voltage of 4.7 V, and amplified that difference with a gain of 10 V/V. The reference voltage was generated using a zener diode in breakdown. The differential amplifier also acted as a low pass filter (capacitor in parallel with op amp\u2019s feedback resistor). Its purpose was to compare the DC signal from the photodetector, so it needed to filter out the pulse signal in order to work properly. Vending Machine Computer [ Top ] Physical implementation [ Bottom ] Block diagram Designed, simulated, built, and tested a circuit that modeled a vending machine. The circuit \"accepted\" quarters, meaning every time a piece of paper or something similar was placed in a sensor (opto-interrupter), a LED display indicating how much change had been put in the machine increased by 25. The machine \u201cdispensed\u201d a soda when the amount deposited was equal to $2.50. When this happened, a seven-segment display had to display a \u201cU\u201d, and after three seconds, the circuit had to reset back to its initial state. Every time a quarter was put into the machine, a tone had to be played and when the soda was dispensed, a melody had to play. If the deposited money was more than $2.50, a change indicator light had to light up (up to $0.50 change - this was represented by a negative sign). MATLAB Tuner Video of tuner in action Designed and coded a device using MATLAB to determine a sampled note pitch compared to a tuning note (A at 440 Hz). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (in this case, time) to a representation in the frequency domain. Since the fundamental harmonic is the lowest harmonic associated with a given pitch, the first peak in a FFT of an audio input is associated with the fundamental frequency. This fundamental frequency was compared to actual note frequencies to determine which pitch it was closest to, then plotted on a graph as compared to the actual note pitch. The tuner also played ideal note pitches (pure sine waves at the correct frequencies) and saved the most recent note progression.","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/#projects","text":"","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/#swarmbots","text":"[ Left ] Tatyana and Nadia [ Right ] Filter/amplification and microphone circuits Modeled and simulated the navigation and environmental sensing of autonomous vehicles by designing a swarmbot team consisting of a community of two robots.

The following gives more detailed descriptions of things enumerated on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Education Tufts University Class of 2020 B.S. in Computer Engineering GPA: 3.91 Santa Cruz High School Class of 2016 Valedictorian Current Work I am currently working at Tulip Interfaces on the IoTH (IoT/Hardware) team. I interned there over the summer, and am continuing my work into the school year as a part-time engineer. Some of the things I am working/have worked on: Installing Tulip OS on x86 devices. This involves getting Tulip's Yocto layer to boot on devices such as the Dell 3002 and Up Squared Board. ADC calibration board PCB design, fabrication, testing, and code integration into Tulip's gateway. Altium was used for the PCB design, and the boards were fabricated without any parts soldered on. I hand-soldered all components onto the boards, which included stable voltage sources (using zener diodes) and Wien Bridge oscillators. The device received power from Tulip's gateway and output voltages, which I then wrote a utility for to calculate ADC calibration coefficients. Wrote eMMC flasher scripts for Nanopi-R1 boards. Using a reference Nanopi image, I added a partition and inserted a Tulip image into the reference image. Once this expanded reference image was burned onto an SD card, I wrote a utility that burned the SD card to the Nanopi's on-board eMMC so that after the SD card was removed, Tulip OS would boot from the eMMC. Hardware and code debug for Gizmo: a version of the MicroWorld clock. Initially used an Arduino as an ISP to load bootloader and .ino code onto the clock's ATMega chip, then switched over to using command line utilities and AVR MKII programmer.
