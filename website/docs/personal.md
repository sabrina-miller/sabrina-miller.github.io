# About Me

I am from Santa Cruz, California, but currently live in Medford, Massachusetts and attend Tufts University where I study Computer Engineering. I do a lot of other things besides mess with computers!

## Music 

I've been playing flute since 2007. I am currently a member of the Tufts Symphony Orchestra, Tufts Wind Ensemble, and Tufts Flute Ensemble. I play many types of flutes - bass, alto, and (unfortunately) piccolo. I used to play the bass trombone as well, although it has been a while. Here's a concerto I played in 2015:

## Photography

I enjoy nature and portrait photography. My camera has taken a bit of a break the past few years, but I am hoping to bring it out again soon. Here's my [SmugMug](https://themillers.smugmug.com/Sabrinas-Photos/).

## Powerlifting

Lifting heavy things is fun! This is my favorite form of physical activity.
